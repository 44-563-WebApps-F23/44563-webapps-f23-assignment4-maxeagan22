        <h1>Max Eagan acts in a play</h1>
        <h4>Title: Enemy of the People Act III</h4>
        <h4>Author: Henrik Isben</h4>

           <h5>Hovstad:</h5> You are perfectly right; but an editor cannot always act as he
            would prefer. He is often obliged to bow to the wishes of the public in
            unimportant matters. Politics are the most important thing in lifeâ€”for
            a newspaper, anyway; and if I want to carry my public with me on the
            path that leads to liberty and progress, I must not frighten them away.
            If they find a moral tale of this sort in the serial at the bottom of
            the page, they will be all the more ready to read what is printed above
            it; they feel more secure, as it were.

            <h5>Petra:</h5> For shame! You would never go and set a snare like that for your 
            readers; you are not a spider!
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>Hovstad (smiling):</h5> Thank you for having such a good opinion of me. No;
            as a matter of fact that is Billing's idea and not mine.
        </p>

        <p><h5>Petra:</h5> Billing's!</p>

        <p>
            <h5>Hovstad:</h5> Yes; anyway, he propounded that theory here one day. And it is
            Billing who is so anxious to have that story in the paper; I don't know
            anything about the book.
        </p>

        <p><h5>Petra:</h5> But how can Billing, with his emancipated views</p>

        <p>
            <h5>Hovstad:</h5>Oh, Billing is a many-sided man. He is applying for the post
            of secretary to the Bench, too, I hear.
